//! Periodic workspace-handoff checkpoint coordinator (REMOTE-2111 Phase 3).
//!
//! Drives the five-state machine described in `docs/remote-2111-checkpoint-spec.md`
//! (warp-server): `Idle -> Due -> InFlight -> Idle` on the periodic path, with
//! `Finalizing -> Stopped` reachable from `Idle`, `Due`, or `InFlight` via
//! [`CheckpointCoordinatorHandle::finalize`]. The timer only ever moves `Idle` to
//! `Due`; all gather/upload/commit work happens through
//! `super::snapshot::run_checkpoint_from_declarations_file`, reusing the same
//! declarations file and gather/upload pipeline as the legacy end-of-run snapshot.
//!
//! Safe-boundary gating ("only touch the filesystem/network when the conversation
//! isn't mid-turn") is implemented as a bounded poll of `AgentDriver`'s own state via
//! its `ModelSpawner`, rather than a push subscription: `AgentDriver` already reads
//! exactly the state needed (`run_conversation_id`, the terminal view's action model)
//! through this same read-only, spawner-based pattern used by `run_snapshot_upload`.
//! This trades a small amount of latency (up to [`SAFE_BOUNDARY_POLL_INTERVAL`]) for
//! avoiding new push-subscription wiring through the UI model graph.
